    "1. Prioritizing Product Categories for Discounts:\n",
    "\n",
    "High Review Count & Moderate-to-High Average Rating:\n",
    "Categories that consistently receive a large number of reviews indicate high popularity and customer engagement. If these categories also maintain a reasonable to high average rating, they are prime candidates for strategic discounts.\n",
    "Why? Discounts in these categories can:\n",
    "Further boost sales volume.\n",
    "Attract new customers who are drawn to popular items.\n",
    "Potentially create a \"halo effect,\" driving traffic to other products within the same category.\n",
    "Categories with High Discount Correlation to Rating_Count:\n",
    "If you find a category where discounts strongly correlate with a high rating count, this means that customers within that category are very discount driven.\n",
    "Example: if the clothing category shows a strong correlation, then deep discounts in that category would strongly drive sales.\n",
    "Categories with Seasonal Demand:\n",
    "Analyze review timestamps (if available) to identify seasonal trends. Offer targeted discounts during peak seasons to capitalize on increased demand.\n",
    "Categories with Competitor Activity:\n",
    "Monitor competitor pricing and discount strategies. If competitors are offering aggressive discounts in a particular category, consider matching or exceeding those discounts to remain competitive.\n",
    "2. Strategies to Improve Sales and Customer Engagement:\n",
    "\n",
    "Targeted Discount Campaigns:\n",
    "Move beyond blanket discounts. Implement personalized discount campaigns based on customer behavior, purchase history, and product preferences.\n",
    "Example: Offer exclusive discounts to repeat customers or bundles of related products.\n",
    "Enhance Product Descriptions and Visuals:\n",
    "Ensure that product descriptions are accurate, informative, and compelling. High-quality images and videos can significantly improve conversion rates.\n",
    "Add user generated content into product pages.\n",
    "Improve Customer Review Management:\n",
    "Actively solicit and respond to customer reviews. Address negative reviews promptly and professionally.\n",
    "Highlight positive reviews to build trust and credibility.\n",
    "Leverage User-Generated Content:\n",
    "Encourage customers to share photos and videos of their purchases. This can create a sense of community and social proof.\n",
    "Optimize Product Categorization and Search:\n",
    "Ensure that products are accurately categorized and that the search functionality is efficient.\n",
    "Implement faceted search to allow customers to filter products by various criteria.\n",
    "Implement a Loyalty Program:\n",
    "Reward repeat customers with exclusive discounts, early access to sales, and other perks.\n",
    "Improve Mobile Experience:\n",
    "Ensure that the website or app is optimized for mobile devices, as a significant portion of online shopping occurs on mobile.\n",
    "Analyze Customer Feedback:\n",
    "Gather customer feedback through surveys, reviews, and social media monitoring. Use this feedback to identify areas for improvement.\n",
    "3. Anomalies and Patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "High Discounts, Low Ratings:\n",
    "Investigate products with high discounts but low ratings. This could indicate:\n",
    "Poor product quality.\n",
    "Misleading product descriptions.\n",
    "Issues with shipping or customer service.\n",
    "Take corrective action to address these issues.\n",

    "Analyze review timestamps to identify any sudden spikes or drops in review counts. This could indicate:\n",
    "A viral marketing campaign.\n",
    "A product recall.\n",
    "A change in product quality.\n",
    "Correlation Between Discount Percentage and Rating:\n",
    "If there is a very weak or no correlation, this shows that discounts are not necessarily a driver of positive reviews.\n",
    "User Review Patterns:\n",
    "Look for patterns in user reviews, such as common complaints or praise. This can provide valuable insights into customer preferences and pain points.\n",
    "Category Review Count Disparity:\n",
    "Large differences in review count between categories may point to marketing or product placement issues.\n",
    "Yearly review patterns:\n",
    "If the data contains date information, then you can analyze the amount of reviews per year. This could show the growth of the business, or the decline"
